# Receive Notifications from Your Supervisor

This application is available directly from the command line, which means no fiddling around with servers!

If you know where you cloned the repo, just put that path into your browser. For example, say you are using Cygwin or MSYS/MinGW and ran `git clone git@github.com:trisys3/lightfeather-notifications.git /c/Users/me/lightfeather-notifications`. In this case, the URL would be `file:///C:/Users/me/lightfeather-notifications/index.html`.

That's it!
